  The essential machinery for being able to reflect an external CI/Build system's job activity 
  in Agile Central is operable.

    The primary features of the Jenkins BLD Connector for Agile Central at this time are:

        Job Build information from Jenkins is reflected in Agile Central in Build records
           (each of which is tied to an AC BuildDefinition record)
       
        Configuration is via a YAML file
            3 sections
                o  AgileCentral system id/creds, workspace and project info 
                o  Jenkins system id/creds, facility for policy based job inclusion/exclusion 
                   via regexes for multiple views/jobs, ability to specify AC targeted project.
                o  Service - to specify Preview status, logging level, policy for jobs 
                   whose name doesn't appear in the specified project.

            provides facility to economically cover interesting jobs on a Jenkins instance
            in a single relatively small and easily understood file.


        Cacheing of AC BuildDefinition info
            reduces time spent getting infrequently changed data

        Can extend to have the connector write in the last processed build time on a
        per Jenkins job basis in the time_file.

        Jenkins Job URI is written to the BuildDefinition at creation time 
          (if one is created in the course of running the connector)
       
        Jenkins Job Build URI is written to the Build record 
          (enables AC user to click on link and see Jenkins page for the specific job)

        You can run multiple configs per invocation.

        If your team/project morphs into another AC project, you might not have to
        update your config file(s) if you've set the Service -> StrictProject to False
          (If you have a BuildDefinition for the job in question associated with another
           Project that the account accessing Agile Central can find, and the original
           Project is moribund or has been renamed, the connector will post the Builds
           to be associated with the BuildDefinition with the Name of the Jenkins job.)

      Ability to handle Jenkins instances that have the CloudBees Folders plugin.
         (in this context a folder is really just a job, that happens to have subsidiary jobs)

         The current way to handle these is to have
         Folders:
            - Folder: <name> 
              # you can settings associated with the above folder, for instance
              #AgileCentral_Project: <some project name>
              #exclude: regex1,regex2 etc
            - Folder: <some other name>

  What remains to be done?

      More industrial sized testing for processing multiple Jenkins Views

      Linkage of Builds to Changeset items
         Jenkins provides information about any VCS id/comments and affected files that led to
         the triggering of a Jenkins Build.
         It may be feasible for the Jenkins BLD Connector to determine whether there are any
         AC Changesets present that match the Jenkins info and use that information in the 
         Build record posted to AC in the Changesets collection.

        Alternatively, if the VCS Changeset info in Jenkins is not reflected in Agile Central,
        it might be feasible to create those AC Changeset items and then include that 
        information in the Build record posted to AC in the Changesets collection.

      Run some tests against almci Jenkins instance, pick some folders, set up some includes/excludes
      and have the AgileCentral section point to the trial AC stack, 
    
      Put it in the hands of the 10 Foot Pole team and get some feedback.
